<!--
This is all based on https://github.com/othneildrew/Best-README-Template, othneildrew's "best-README-Template". I only made some edits 
that I thought were making things clearer

When starting a new readme file, to avoid retyping too much info. Do a search and replace with your text editor for the following:**
`github_username`, `repo`, `twitter_handle`, `email`, `project_title`, `project_description`, 'linkedin_username'

If you want to use markdown or HTML but you are not familiar check: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#reference-style-links

<!-- I think the table of contents is cleaner and more readable in markdown, so using markdown for these parts
the basics are, put whatever you want to show up in [] put whatever you want to link to in () the linking part cannot
have any spaces/characters, replaces spaces with - (_ does not work) the numbering should be indiferent (as you can see below) -->
