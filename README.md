<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This is a very general readme file, that explains how to use or setup certain functions.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

The whole project is a mix of HTML and Markdown. I personally find Markdown easier to read, but HTML has sometimes more options. For example to align text (see the title or the discription) you need HTML, but to have a clean and easy to create index, Markdown looks better.

### Built With

This readme was downloaded with using Rstudio. You can use a lot of different programs, but R studio allows you to create a preview very easily, so you can see very quickly if it works what you did.
* [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)

However, you can just do the whole thing online in Github by clicking on the readme.md file and clicking the pencil button to edit.



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To download this in Rstudio you need the language [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) + the [Git plugin](https://gitforwindows.org/). Once you have all 3 installed you should be able to download any repo and edit the readme files. 
[See this tutorial for more info.](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html)

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

You can do a lot of things in these readme files. For example you can add images:
[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)
This is an example of how to enter a figure, if you save the figure in your repo, you can link to it directly (it might be helpful when uploading figure/plots). 

You can link to any website by typing something inside [] directly followed by the url in (), make sure there are no spaces between []()

You can also add code, the easiest way of doing it is by adding 3 \``` followed by the language, 1 enter, the code, one enter and finishing with \```
This will end up looking like this 
```matlab
matlabfucntion2.1() % whatever
```

### adding headers 
adding headers is done by putting # infront of a sentence or word followed by a space. The more # the smaller the header. Small reminder, if you add a header, also add it to the index. To add something to the index put whatever you want to show up in [] put whatever you want to link to in () the linking starts with a # cannot contain capitals,spaces or underscores replace these with a - . As you can see in the index part, the number before the index does not matter, it'll calculate the right order itself.
