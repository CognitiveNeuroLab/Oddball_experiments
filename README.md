<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In this repo everyone can add all the the oddball paradigms that are being ran at the CNL. Currently in this repo:
1- visual oddbal
2- auditory duration tone oddball




<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Visual Oddball

### Visual spacial oddball

For this oddball the soa is changing [(similar to the auditory Duration tone oddball)](#duration-tone-oddball).  
The standard is happenin 80% of the time, it is a triangle that shows up in the middle of the screen.
The deviant is happens 20% of the time, never in a row, by showing up lower then the Standard.
We still need to decide how many trails we need per block

## Auditory oddball

### Duration tone oddball

For this oddball the soa is changing, there is a 225-450-900-1800-3000 ms SOA.  
The standard is happenin 80% of the time, it is a 100ms 1000hz tone.
The deviant is happens 20% of the time, never in a row, it is a 180ms 1000hz tone..
We still need to decide how many trails we need per block
